            <h3>Wear A Face Mask</h3>
            <p>Experts agree that wearing face masks can protect people’s health and slow the spread of COVID-19. That’s because the novel coronavirus can be transmitted through respiratory droplets that get into the air from sneezing, coughing or even speaking. A mask acts as a barrier, stopping those droplets before they reach another person. Covers your nose and mouth and secure it under your chin. If you are not fully vaccinated and aged 2 or older, you should wear a mask in indoor public places.Wear a mask correctly and consistently for the best protection.</p>

                Touching your eyes, nose, or mouth,
                touching your mask,
                entering and leaving a public place,

                If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.
                Outside your home: Put 6 feet of distance between yourself and people who don’t live in your household.
                Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.
                Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arm lengths) from other people.
                Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick.</p>

                Avoid indoor spaces that do not offer fresh air from the outdoors as much as possible.
                If indoors, bring in fresh air by opening windows and doors, if possible.Clean high touch surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.</p>

            <h3>Why we should take vaccine</h3>
            <h4></h4>
            <p>Vaccination is the most effective way to protect against infectious diseases. 

                Vaccines strengthen our immune system by training it to recognise and fight against specific viruses. 
                
                When we get vaccinated, we are protecting yourself and helping to protect the whole community. 
                    A vaccine protects the person immunized and decreases the spread of that disease to others.
                    
                    
                    By vaccinating most people, we can protect our entire community from diseases. If enough people choose not to vaccinate, it leaves an opening for disease to break through and spread. It’s important for everyone to take part in protecting all members of our community.

            <h3>DO'S AND DONT'S after vaccinated</h3>
            <p> It is commonly observed that after getting vaccinated, people experience mild fever, bodyache, chills and fatigue – if not all of these, then some. Some feel unpleasant and dizzy post-vaccination, or even a strong pain in their arm post the vaccination. However, what experts have consistently said is, “Don’t worry about the after-effects of the COVID vaccination.” These effects on your body are not a problem, but rather signs that your body is naturally reacting to the vaccine which is crucial for it to work properly. Don’t term it as side-effects, but these are mere after-effects.</p>
